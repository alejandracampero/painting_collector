### Art Library

Art Library was developed with the objective of creating a collection of notable artists in which users can add to their authenticated account . All users are able to add any individual artistâ€™s information, type of art they created, and upload pictures of the piece of art. They are able to choose from an existing pieces of art list that can be linked to their artist. Users are also able to add information/descriptions on artists/pieces of art they have uploaded for other users to view. Each user has exclusive rights to edit and delete the artist or piece of art they added.
